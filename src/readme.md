Caching for Improved Performance:

Implement Category Caching: Use local storage or session storage to cache category data (name, book count, etc.) for faster page loads. This avoids unnecessary API calls for frequently accessed categories.
Cache Expiry: Implement a time-based expiry for the cache to refresh the category data periodically.
Cache Invalidation: After any modification (add/edit/delete) to categories, invalidate the cached data and fetch fresh data from the server.
Multilingual Support:

Language Selector: Add a dropdown or a floating button at the top to allow users to choose their preferred language (e.g., English, Hindi, Marathi, etc.).
Content Translation: Implement a translation mechanism (could use a third-party API like Google Translate or integrate your own translation files) to dynamically translate text, such as category names, buttons, and notifications, into the selected language.
Store Language Preference: Use localStorage or cookies to save the user’s language preference for future visits.
Quick Access Button (Settings, Import, Export):

Settings: Allow users to access settings where they can modify preferences like language, theme (light/dark mode), and notification preferences.
Import: Implement an import functionality that allows users to upload a CSV, Excel, or JSON file to bulk add categories and books.
Export: Provide an option for users to export the entire categories list (including book data) as a CSV or Excel file.
Quick Access Button Placement: Position the button in a fixed position at the bottom-right of the page for easy access at all times. This should open a small modal or dropdown with the options (Settings, Import, Export).
Advanced Search & Filtering:

Category Search by Name: Enhance the search bar with autocomplete suggestions and highlight matching terms.
Multi-criteria Filtering: Allow users to filter categories based on parameters such as the number of books, creation date, etc.
Search Across Languages: If the app is multilingual, ensure that the search can handle content in different languages and filter accordingly.
Category Management:

Bulk Actions: Allow users to perform bulk actions such as deleting multiple categories or books at once using checkboxes next to each category.
Category Sorting: Add options to sort categories by name, book count, or last modified date.
Category Hierarchy: Implement a nested category structure where categories can have subcategories. This would help in creating more granular organization, such as “Fiction” → “Science Fiction” → “Fantasy”.
Notifications & Alerts:

Real-time Category Updates: Use WebSockets or polling to notify the user of changes to categories or books in real-time (e.g., if another user adds a new category).
Low Stock Alerts: Display real-time alerts for categories that have low stock in the associated books. This can be linked to the book inventory system.
